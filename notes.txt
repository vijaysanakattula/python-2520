-> Nested COnditionals : Conditionals inside Conditionals
-> Nested Loops : Loops inside Loop


-> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)
    -> break : helps you exit loops
    -> Continue : helps you skip the current iteration in loop
    -> pass : acts as a placeholder, for doing nothing

-> Simple data types
    -> Can hold one value 
    -> data = 10 

-> Complex Data types 
    -> Can hold multiple values
    -> data = [10,20,30,40,50]

-> In python (part of standard library), we use follwoing classes to work with complex data types
    -> List
    -> Tuple 
    -> Dictionary 
    -> Set 

1. List:
    -> List is a data structure which allows you to store multiple values in a single variable 
    -> Lists are represented using [] or use list class ==> list()
    -> Accessing the data in Lists 
        -> Like in Strings, we have index which starts from 0
        -> Use index number to access individual elements
        -> Both positive and negative indexing
        -> Indexing is same as Strings 
        -> Slicing is same as strings 

    -> Looping
    -> Operators 
    -> Conditionals 
    -> Duplicates allowed 
    -> List Methods / Operations

=============
-> List Methods Continued..

-> Lsist Characteristics 
    -> order: Lists is ordered (inserion order is preserved)
    -> Mutable : Lists can be modified (append,clear)
    -> Duplicates : Allowed 
    -> Can we hold different data types : Yes 

2. Tuples:
    -> Tuples is a data structure which allows you to store multiple values in a single variable 
    -> Tuples are represented using () or use list class ==> list()
    -> Accessing the data in Tuples 
        -> Like in Strings, we have index which starts from 0
        -> Use index number to access individual elements
        -> Both positive and negative indexing
        -> Indexing is same as Strings 
        -> Slicing is same as strings 
        -> Tuples are Immutable 

    -> Looping
    -> Operators 
    -> Conditionals 
    -> Duplicates allowed 
    -> Tuples Methods / Operations 


23rd SEP 2025
==========
-> Dictionary (Mapping Type of Data)
-> Dictionary is a data structure which allows you to multiplekey, values in a single 
    -> key, value -> pair / item 
        key:value,key:value
    -> dictionaries are represented using { } or use tuple class ==> dict()
-> There is no index in dictionaries
-> NO Indexing
-> No Slicing 
-> Rule 
    -> keys cannot be duplicate (it will override the data)
    -> keys should be Immutable objects only (95% or above keys will be strings)
    -> values can be duplicates 
    -> values can be any object 

-> In dictionaries, we access
